# ChainAgile_Blockchain
This repository contains a dataset used to perform performance tests on a blockchain system for the research paper "ChainAgile: A Blockchain-based Framework for Distributed Scrum Agile Software Development". The dataset includes information on latency and size for 700 blocks, measured during the tests.

## Dataset Details
The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and contains the following columns:

1. **Block**: Represents the block number.
2. **Latency**: Indicates the time it took for a block to be added to the blockchain, measured in milliseconds.
3. **Size**: Represents the size of the block in the blockchain, measured in bytes.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the dataset.
